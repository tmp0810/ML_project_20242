# HOW TO USE

## Locally with docker

1. Navigate to "Docker_deployment/demo_20NG" or "Docker_deployment/demo_r8"

2. Build the docker image

```
docker build --no-cache -t topic-classification-app .
```

3. Run the image

```
docker run -p 7860:7860 topic-classification-app
```

4. Access the app

Enter the app with your browser using the URL: http://localhost:7860/

## Without docker

1. Navigate to "Docker_deployment/demo_20NG" or "Docker_deployment/demo_r8"

2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Modify the **app.launch()** option in **app.py**

- Change it to 

```
app.launch()
```

if you just want to access the app locally. Access the app at http://localhost:7860

- Or you can change it to 

```
app.launch(share=True)
```

to get a public URL so others can access your app with internet.

Then the app is accessible at http://localhost:7860 or via a public URL generated by **gradio**
