## üê≥ Run It Locally with Docker (Fast & Isolated)

1. **Choose Your Dataset Flavor**
   Navigate to either of these directories depending on the dataset you want to explore:

   * `Docker_deployment/demo_20NG` (20 Newsgroups)
   * `Docker_deployment/demo_r8` (Reuters-8)

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   Run the following command to build a fresh image (no cache used):

   ```bash
   docker build --no-cache -t topic-classification-app .
   ```

3. **Start the Container**
   Fire up the app by mapping port 7860:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 7860:7860 topic-classification-app
   ```

4. **Launch in Your Browser**
   Open [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860) and enjoy the interactive demo!
